# MMSlibs
MMSlibs is a collection of all libraries developed for the Modular Measurement System.
The Libraries will be moved to their own repositories soon, to enable integration into projects from GitHub via PlatformIO.

The following Libraries are included:
- MAIN: Library for the MAIN module. Contains functions for measuring the enviromental temperature and pressure with the intgrated sensors of the module.
- TCO: Library for the TCO module. Contains functions for the TCO module for measuring temperatures with up to eight K-type thermocouples.
- RTD: Library for the RTD module. Contains funcitons for the RTD module for measuring temperatures with up to four Pt100 RTD sensors.
- ADC: Library for the ADC module. Contains functions for the ADC module for measuring up to eight single-ended or four differential analog voltages.
- FRQ: Library for the FRQ module. Contains functions for the FRQ module for measuring on frequency signal. Program code for the additional microcontroller used for the frequency measurement is included in the file as well.
- PRS: Library for the PRS module. Contains functions for the PRS module for measuring up to eight pressure inputs with honeywelle pressure sensors.
